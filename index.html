<h3>Fun Facts About Me</h3>

<h3>Philosophy on Life</h3>
<p>
    I believe that life is a journey of continuous learning, growth, and exploration. I find purpose in curiosity—whether it’s understanding how a car works or how to build something new—and I strive to approach every experience with an open mind and a spirit of discovery. I value the joy that comes from being active, from playing sports like basketball to embracing the thrill of road trips and adventures in the great outdoors. At the same time, I recognize that life is too short to get caught up in unnecessary conflicts or negativity. I surround myself with good people who bring positive energy, kindness, and laughter. I understand that we are all here for a limited time, and because of that, I choose to focus on what truly matters: meaningful connections, memorable experiences, and the simple joys of life. Rather than worrying about material things, I prioritize the things that bring genuine happiness and fulfillment—like the beauty of the outdoors, the excitement of new adventures, and the friendships that make every moment worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
    The reason I chose computer science is because I love making a difference in the world, and I feel that this degree can open many different paths that can help someone in need. For example, I used to work at a non-profit organization that helped children with eyesight problems worldwide. Although I was on the finance team, I was invited to a gala by the company where I had the opportunity to listen to an employee in the computer science field describe how they worked to create software that helped diagnose and treat children more effectively. I was amazed by the impact one can make!
